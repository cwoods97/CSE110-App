# About Us:

SpeakEasy is a web application developed by eleven UCSD students with the goal of helping speakers improve their public speaking skills and the process of receiving feedback. SpeakEasy empowers speakers with the ability to easily review speeches they have given in the past to identify elements they can improve. Audience members can actively engage with the speaker with quick and easy predefined feedback, such as indicating that they are speaking too fast or slow, which the speaker can view effortlessly. This contrasts with the current traditional and disruptive way of interrupting the speaker to tell them a trivial piece of information. All of this is available to the audience at the tap of a simple button.
Developed with a growth mindset, we believe that there is always room for improvement. SpeakEasy can be used in a range of environments, from small lectures to presentations with hundreds of people. Our application is easy to use with a simple goal to provide a positive experience for all users.

# Known Bugs:

Audio Playbar Bug:
On a review session page of a session with audio recording, when the user clicks the triangular play button, the audio starts playing back. However, the user wonâ€™t be able to change the current position on the timeline.
This bug is due to the recorder not successfully storing the metadata of the recording. We are working to fix this bug.

# Features In-Progress:

Reviewing Predefined Feedback without Audio:
On a review session page of a session without an audio recording, the user cannot review the predefined feedback. The user can review the customized feedback.
